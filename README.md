# [ Cracked Craft Rise Launcher (the exe one) ]
+ I made this buildable because i was bored and it was not obfuscated, so it just for fun. It is the launcher which opens the "launcher.jar" so actually it does nothing.

# [ info ]

</div>

+ Dear Craftrise developers, zort. (If you dmca that means you cope, and it will just be reposted by others so no point.)

# [ Usage ]

+ Open .sln file on visual studio and compile it.
+ Or just download the release, but it is really craftrise launcher so you dont need it lol
